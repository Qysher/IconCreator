# IconCreator
A minimal application to create icons with a uniform style.

# Requirements
- Java 1.8 or later
- A basic button icon (you can use the [example button](https://github.com/Qysher/IconCreator/blob/master/examples/exampleBackground.png).

# Usage
1. Download the latest version under the [Release](https://github.com/Qysher/IconCreator/releases) tab. 
2. Run the application
3. Select a background image by either clicking the [...] button next to the text field. (Alternatively you can drag and drop your image onto the text field).
4. For the foreground image you can do the same. A fast and easy way to get the icon of an application is using my [IconExtractor](https://github.com/Qysher/IconExtractor) script. For testing you can just use the [example icon](https://github.com/Qysher/IconCreator/blob/master/examples/exampleForeground.png)
5. The overlay is just another layer like the foreground image. It is used to give your buttons a nice effect. [example overlay](https://github.com/Qysher/IconCreator/blob/master/examples/exampleOverlay.png)
6. (Optional) Override Color is a feature used to recolor icons (for better identifiability).
7. (Optional) Margin: add a margin to the foreground image, to make the proportions look right.
8. Background Brightness: the background brightness is only for the preview window.
9. Save your icon by clicking on the save button. You have to enter a name (the default name is iterated by default).

## Advanced (Batch Mode)
1. Dial in your settings and prepare your icons.
2. Click on the [Batch Mode] button.
3. Select the desired foreground icons and klick "open".
4. Next you have to select where to save the icons and click on save (it is recommended to create a new folder for this step).
5. Check if everything worked by controlling the buttons. You can use different settings for buttons that didnt work out like you wanted.
